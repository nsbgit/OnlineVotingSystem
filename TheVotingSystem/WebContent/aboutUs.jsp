			<p align="center" style="color: #1919D1"><b>An automated voting system comprising single or multiple voting stations for controlling<br>
			   				  and being a voting station simultaneously.The voting system ...<br>
			   				  A voting system or electoral system is a method by which voters make a choice between options,<br>
			   				  often in an election or on a policy referendum.<br>
							  A voting system enforces rules to ensure valid voting,<br>
							  and how votes are counted and aggregated to yield a final result.<br>
							  Common voting systems are majority rule, proportional representation or plurality voting<br>
							  with a number of variations and methods such as first-past-the-post or preferential voting.<br>
							  The study of formally defined voting systems is called social choice theory or voting theory,<br>
							  a subfield of political science, economics, or mathematics.<br>
							  With majority rule, those who are unfamiliar with voting theory are often surprised that<br>
							  another voting system exists, or that disagreements may exist over the definition of what<br>
							  it means to be supported by a majority[citation needed]. Depending on the meaning chosen,<br>
							  the common "majority rule" systems can produce results that the majority does not support.<br>
							  If every election had only two choices, the winner would be determined using majority rule alone.<br>
							  However, when there are three or more options, there may not be<br>
							  a single option that is most liked or most disliked by a majority.<br>
							  A simple choice does not allow voters to express the ordering or the intensity of their feeling.<br> 
							  Different voting systems may give very different results,<br>
							  particularly in cases where there is no clear majority preference.<br></b>
